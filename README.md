# Warp White Noise Box
---
I had an emergency call box sitting around and decided that I wanted to convert it into a simple box that plays the Star Trek Next Generation ambient engine noise.

The sound file is derived from here: https://archive.org/details/AmbientEngineNoiseidlingFor24Hrs_614

Plays for 6 hours.
